**Lansweeper's Flow Builder** is a low-code Workflow tool your team can use to build Workflows that sync data between Lansweeper Platform and the other apps and services you use.

Your Workflows use built-in connectors to connect to third-party apps.
Using these connectors, you can query for data in a third-party app to import into Lansweeper Platform, or you can export data from Lansweeper Platform to another service.

If you're syncing data between Lansweeper Platform and a proprietary system you've built, you can leverage the generic [HTTP connector](./connectors/http.md) to make [requests](./http-requests.md) to any API that does not already have a built-in connector.

If you'd like to write code to help solve your problem, you can add JavaScript [code steps](./custom-code.md) to your Workflow to manipulate data, make additional requests, or perform any other custom logic you need.

To get started building, check out our [getting started guide](./get-started.md).
