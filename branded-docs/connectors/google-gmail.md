## Connections

### OAuth2

OAuth2 Connection

The Gmail component authenticates requests through the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) OAuth 2.0 service.
You'll need to create a GCP OAuth 2.0 app so your integration can authenticate and perform Gmail tasks on your customers' behalf.

To create a Gmail OAuth 2.0 app, first make sure you have a Google Developer account - you can sign up at [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
Then:

1. Open up the Gmail API console - [https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/gmail.googleapis.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/gmail.googleapis.com)
1. You will be prompted to enable **Gmail API** for your project. Click **ENABLE**.
1. On the sidebar, select **APIs & Services** and then **Credentials**.
1. An OAuth 2.0 app includes a "Consent Screen" (the page that asks "Do you want to allow (Your Company) to access Gmail on your behalf?"). Click **CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN**.
   1. Your app will be externally available to your customers, so choose a **User Type** of **External**.
   1. Fill out the OAuth consent screen with an app name (your company or product's name), support email, app logo, domain, etc.
   1. You can ignore domains for now.
   1. On the next page, add any scopes relevant to your integration, like `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send`.
   1. Enter some **test users** for your testing purposes.
      Your app will only work for those testing users until it is "verified" by Google.
      When you are ready for verification (they verify your privacy policy statement, etc), click **PUBLISH APP** on the **OAuth consent screen**.
      That'll allow your customers to authorize your integration to access their Gmail account.
1. Once your "Consent Screen" is configured open the **Credentials** page from the sidebar again.
1. Click **+CREATE CREDENTIALS** and select **OAuth Client ID**.
   1. Under **Application type** select **Web application**.
   1. Under **Authorized redirect URIs** enter the OAuth 2.0 callback URL: `https://oauth2.Lansweeper.com/callback`.
   1. Click **CREATE**.
1. Take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** that are generated.

:::info
Make sure to **publish** your OAuth 2.0 app after you've tested it so users outside of your _test users_ can authorize your integration to interact with Gmail on their behalf.
:::

Now that you have a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, add Gmail step to your workflow.
Open the **Configuration Wizard Designer** by clicking **Configuration Wizard**, select your **Gmail Connection** and enter your client ID and secret.

:::info A note on scopes
You can keep the default [Gmail scope](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/auth/scopes), `https://mail.google.com/`.
This will grant you full permission over your users' Gmail accounts.

If you would like to limit permissions, you can select a subset of scopes, like `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send`.

This connection uses OAuth 2.0, a common authentication mechanism for integrations.
Read about how OAuth 2.0 works [here](../oauth2.md).

### Service Account

Service Account Connection

In order to use the **Service Account** Authentication method for Gmail, you'll need to:

1. Create a Service Account in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
   This can be done [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and then navigating to **Service Accounts**
2. Once a Service Account is created, you will need to generate a Service Account Key
   This can be done by clicking on the Service Account's options, navigating to the **Key** tab, and clicking **Add Key** to create a new key.
3. After creating the key, you will be able to download a JSON file that contains the key information. This key **contains sensible data** and should be used with caution.
4. Use the key downloaded in the previous step as input for the Gmail 'Service Account' connection.
5. Lastly, if needed, specify a granular scope, take into account that the connection defaults to the **https://mail.google.com/** scope, which gives full access to the Gmail API on your behalf.

This is used when 'Use Exponential Backoff' is disabled.                                                                                                                                                                            | 0       |
| Retry On All Errors     | If true, retries on all erroneous responses regardless of type. This is helpful when retrying after HTTP 429 or other 3xx or 4xx errors. Otherwise, only retries on HTTP 5xx and network errors.                                                                               | false   |

| Use Exponential Backoff | Specifies whether to use a pre-defined exponential backoff strategy for retries. When enabled, 'Retry Delay (ms)' is ignored.                                                                                                                                                  | false   |
