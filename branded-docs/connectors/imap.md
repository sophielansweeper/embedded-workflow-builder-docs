## Connections

### IMAP Connection

Provide the details of your IMAP server.

To configure a connection to an IMAP server you will need a few properties:

- The host and port of your IMAP server
- A set of login credentials for a user that exists on the IMAP server
- The version of encryption the IMAP server is compatible with.

The setup can vary widely depending on the email service you are using.
We have provided a bit of context around some popular services to get you started.

#### Connecting to Gmail

To set up an IMAP connection to your Gmail account, you need to create a [Google App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).
Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/) and select 'Security'.
Under "Signing in to Google," select App Passwords. You may need to sign in.

If you don't have this option, it might be because:

- 2 Step Verification is not set up for your account.
- 2 Step Verification is only set up for security keys.
- Your account is through work, school, or other organization.
- You turned on Advanced Protection.

At the bottom, click **Select App** and choose **Mail**, and then click **Select device** and choose **Other (Custom name)**.
Then, click **GENERATE**.
You'll be given a 16-character code, which is your **app password**.
Copy that somewhere safe.

Finally, create a connection and provide these values:

- Enter `imap.gmail.com` for the host
- The default values for port and security are fine
- Enter the username or email of your Gmail account
- Enter the **app password** you created earlier

If you run into authentication problems, ensure that your account has [IMAP enabled](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229).

#### Connecting to Microsoft Office 365

If your Office 365 domain does not use multi-factor authentication (this is rare), then you can use your username and password to authenticate.

If MFA is enabled, you will need to create an **app password** to authenticate.
To create an app password, log in to the [Microsoft Security Center](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info) and open the **Security info** tab.
Click **+Add method** and choose **App password**.

If you don't have an **app password** option, you'll need to contact your Office 365 administrator and have them [enable it](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/manage-app-passwords-for-two-step-verification-d6dc8c6d-4bf7-4851-ad95-6d07799387e9).

Give your app password a name, and copy the password that is generated.

Now, create a connection and provide these values:

- Enter `outlook.office365.com` for the host
- The default values for port and security are fine
- Enter the username or email of your Outlook account
- Enter your password or the app password you generated
