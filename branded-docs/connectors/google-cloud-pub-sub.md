| BigQuery Config                  | If delivery to BigQuery is used with this subscription, this field is used to configure it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         |
| Ack Deadline Seconds             | The approximate amount of time (on a best-effort basis) Pub/Sub waits for the subscriber to acknowledge receipt before resending the message. In the interval after the message is delivered and before it is acknowledged, it is considered to be outstanding. During that time period, the message will not be redelivered (on a best-effort basis). For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using non-streaming pull or send the ackId in a StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest if using streaming pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used. |         |
| Retain Acked Messages            | Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If true, then messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the messageRetentionDuration window. This must be true if you would like to subscriptions.seek to a timestamp in the past to replay previously-acknowledged messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | false   |
| Message Retention Duration       | Indicates the minimum duration to retain a message after it is published to the topic. If this field is set, messages published to the topic in the last messageRetentionDuration are always available to subscribers. For instance, it allows any attached subscription to seek to a timestamp that is up to messageRetentionDuration in the past. If this field is not set, message retention is controlled by settings on individual subscriptions. Cannot be more than 31 days or less than 10 minutes. A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with 's'. Example: '1200s'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         |

| Enable Message Ordering          | If true, messages published with the same orderingKey in PubsubMessage will be delivered to the subscribers in the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they may be delivered in any order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | false   |
| Expiration Policy                | A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's expiration. A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing operations on the subscription. If expirationPolicy is not set, a default policy with ttl of 31 days will be used. The minimum allowed value for expirationPolicy.ttl is 1 day. If expirationPolicy is set, but expirationPolicy.ttl is not set, the subscription never expires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |         |
| Filter                           | An expression written in the Pub/Sub filter language. If non-empty, then only PubsubMessages whose attributes field matches the filter are delivered on this subscription. If empty, then no messages are filtered out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         |
| Dead Letter Policy               | A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering messages in this subscription.

| Retry Policy                     | A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for this subscription. If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers. RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |         |
| Detached                         | Indicates whether the subscription is detached from its topic. Detached subscriptions don't receive messages from their topic and don't retain any backlog. subscriptions.pull and StreamingPull requests will return FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the subscription is a push subscription, pushes to the endpoint will not be made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | false   |

| Resource   | The resource for which the policy is being requested. See [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names) for the appropriate value for this field.                                          |         |
| Policy     | The complete policy to be applied to the resource. The size of the policy is limited to a few 10s of KB. An empty policy is a valid policy but certain Google Cloud services (such as Projects) might reject them. |         |

### Update Push Config

This may be used to change a push subscription to a pull one (signified by an empty PushConfig) or vice versa, or change the endpoint URL and other attributes of a push subscription.

| Push Endpoint                    | A URL locating the endpoint to which messages should be pushed. For example, a Webhook endpoint might use https://example.com/push.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         |
| Attributes                       | Endpoint configuration attributes that can be used to control different aspects of the message delivery. The only currently supported attribute is x-goog-version, which you can use to change the format of the pushed message. This attribute indicates the version of the data expected by the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message (i.e., its fields and metadata). The only supported values for the x-goog-version attribute are: - v1beta1: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API. - v1 or v1beta2: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API. |         |
| Oidc Token                       | If specified, Pub/Sub will generate and attach an OIDC JWT token as an Authorization header in the HTTP request for every pushed message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |         |

| Ack Deadline Seconds             | The approximate amount of time (on a best-effort basis) Pub/Sub waits for the subscriber to acknowledge receipt before resending the message. In the interval after the message is delivered and before it is acknowledged, it is considered to be outstanding. During that time period, the message will not be redelivered (on a best-effort basis). For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using non-streaming pull or send the ackId in a StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest if using streaming pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used. |         |
| Retain Acked Messages            | Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If true, then messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the messageRetentionDuration window. This must be true if you would like to subscriptions.seek to a timestamp in the past to replay previously-acknowledged messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | false   |
| Message Retention Duration       | Indicates the minimum duration to retain a message after it is published to the topic. If this field is set, messages published to the topic in the last messageRetentionDuration are always available to subscribers. For instance, it allows any attached subscription to seek to a timestamp that is up to messageRetentionDuration in the past. If this field is not set, message retention is controlled by settings on individual subscriptions. Cannot be more than 31 days or less than 10 minutes. A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with 's'. Example: '1200s'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         |

| Enable Message Ordering          | If true, messages published with the same orderingKey in PubsubMessage will be delivered to the subscribers in the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they may be delivered in any order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | false   |
| Expiration Policy                | A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's expiration. A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing operations on the subscription. If expirationPolicy is not set, a default policy with ttl of 31 days will be used. The minimum allowed value for expirationPolicy.ttl is 1 day. If expirationPolicy is set, but expirationPolicy.ttl is not set, the subscription never expires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |         |
| Filter                           | An expression written in the Pub/Sub filter language. If non-empty, then only PubsubMessages whose attributes field matches the filter are delivered on this subscription. If empty, then no messages are filtered out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         |
| Dead Letter Policy               | A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering messages in this subscription. If deadLetterPolicy is not set, dead lettering is disabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |         |
| Retry Policy                     | A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for this subscription. If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers. RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |         |
| Detached                         | Indicates whether the subscription is detached from its topic. Detached subscriptions don't receive messages from their topic and don't retain any backlog. subscriptions.pull and StreamingPull requests will return FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the subscription is a push subscription, pushes to the endpoint will not be made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | false   |
| Enable Exactly Once Delivery     | If true, Pub/Sub provides the following guarantees for the delivery of a message with a given value of messageId on this subscription: - The message sent to a subscriber is guaranteed not to be resent before the message's acknowledgement deadline expires. - An acknowledged message will not be resent to a subscriber.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | false   |
| Topic Message Retention Duration | Output only. Indicates the minimum duration for which a message is retained after it is published to the subscription's topic. If this field is set, messages published to the subscription's topic in the last topicMessageRetentionDuration are always available to subscribers. See the messageRetentionDuration field in Topic. This field is set only in responses from the server; it is ignored if it is set in any requests. A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with 's'. Example: '1200s'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |         |
| State                            | Output only. An output-only field indicating whether or not the subscription can receive messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         |
