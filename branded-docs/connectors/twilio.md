## Connections

### Twilio API Key Connection

Authenticate requests to Twilio using an API key

This component authenticates with Twilio using API key/secret pairs that can be generated from Twilio's app console.
To create a Twilio API key and secret pair:

- Go to the Twilio [console](https://console.twilio.com/)
- On the top-right of the screen click **Account** -> **API Keys & Tokens**
- Select **Create API Key**
- Give your key a name and select **Standard** for **Key type**
- Take note of the API key's **SID** and **Secret** - you will enter those in a moment

Now, when you create an integration that uses Twilio, a "Twilio API Key Connection" will automatically be generated.
Enter your **API Key SID** (starts with "SK..."), and its **Secret**.
Go back to your Twilio console to find your **Account SID** (starts with "AC..."), and enter that as well.

| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Account SID    | Your account SID (starts with AC)                             |         |
| API Key SID    | An API Key SID (starts with SK)                               |         |
| API Key Secret | The API secret that was generated when an API key was created |         |

### Twilio Auth Token Connection

Authenticate requests using account SID and auth token

When you create a Twilio account, an **Account String Identifier** (Account SID) and **Auth Token** are generated.
You can use the account SID and auth token to authenticate with Twilio and to send SMS messages.

:::caution Consider API Keys instead
For security reasons, we recommend using an [API Key Connection](#twilio-api-key-connection) instead.
API keys can be revoked and auth tokens generated using API keys are short-lived.
