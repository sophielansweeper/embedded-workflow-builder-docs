| Retry On All Errors                 | If true, retries on all erroneous responses regardless of type. This is helpful when retrying after HTTP 429 or other 3xx or 4xx errors. Otherwise, only retries on HTTP 5xx and network errors. | false   |
| Timeout                             | The maximum time that a client will await a response to its request                                                                                                                              |         |
| Include Full Response               | Enabling this flag will include the full response instead of only the returned data.                                                                                                             | false   |
| Debug Request                       | Enabling this flag will log out the current request.                                                                                                                                             | false   |
| Ignore SSL Errors (Not Recommended) | When this flag is enabled, SSL certificate errors will be ignored. Use this flag with caution - ignoring SSL errors presents security issues. This should only be used for testing purposes.     | false   |
