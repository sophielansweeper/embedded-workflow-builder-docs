| Verbose       | If present and equal to 1, Mixpanel will respond with a JSON Object describing the success or failure of the tracking call. The returned object will have two keys: status, with the value 1 on success and 0 on failure, and error, with a string-valued error message if the request wasn't successful. This is useful for debugging during implementation. |         |
| Redirect      | If present, Mixpanel will serve a redirect to the given url as a response to the request.

### Create Profile

Takes a JSON object containing names and values of profile properties. This API will return a 200 OK even if there are data validation issues. To ensure the request actually succeeded, you need to check the response body.

| Distinct IDs      | A unique identifier used to distinguish an individual profile. Could be an array of identifiers.                                                                                                                                                                                         | <code>["000xxx"]</code> |
| Where             | An expression to filter users by. See the expressions section above. https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/segmentation-expressions                                                                                                                                                   |                         |
| Output Properties | A JSON array of names of properties you want returned. This parameter can drastically reduce the amount of data returned by the API when you're not interested in all properties and can speed up queries significantly.                                                                 | <code>["000xxx"]</code> |
| Session ID        | A string id provided in the results of a previous query. Using a session_id speeds up api response, and allows paging through results.                                                                                                                                                   |                         |
| Page              | Which page of the results to retrieve. Pages start at zero. If the 'page' parameter is provided, the session_id parameter must also be provided.                                                                                                                                         |                         |
| Behaviors         | If you are exporting user profiles using an event selector, you use a behaviors parameter in your request. behaviors and filter_by_cohort are mutually exclusive.                                                                                                                        |                         |
| As Of Timestamp   | This parameter is only useful when also using behaviors. If you try to export more than 1k profiles using a behaviors parameter and you don't included the parameter as_of_timestamp, you'll see the following error: request for page in uncached query for params                      |                         |
| Filter By Cohort  | Takes a JSON object with a single key called id whose value is the cohort ID. behaviors and filter_by_cohort are mutually exclusive.                                                                                                                                                     |                         |
| Include All Users | If set to true means that the Engage API will include distinct_ids that don't have a user profile. This is the default. If set to false, means that the Engage API will only include distinct_ids with user profiles. this parameter is only applied when combined with filter_by_cohort | true                    |

| Region            | The server location to be used: _ `api` - The default (US) servers used for most projects _ `api-eu` - EU servers if you are enrolled in EU Data Residency                                                                                                                                                                                                    |         |
| IP                | If present and equal to 1, Mixpanel will use the ip address of the incoming request and compute a distinct_id using a hash function if no distinct_id is provided. This is different from providing a properties.ip value in the Event Object.                                                                                                                |         |
| Verbose           | If present and equal to 1, Mixpanel will respond with a JSON Object describing the success or failure of the tracking call. The returned object will have two keys: status, with the value 1 on success and 0 on failure, and error, with a string-valued error message if the request wasn't successful. This is useful for debugging during implementation. |         |
| Redirect          | If present, Mixpanel will serve a redirect to the given url as a response to the request. This is useful to add link tracking in notifications.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |         |
| Img               | If present and equal to 1, Mixpanel will serve a 1x1 transparent pixel image as a response to the request. This is useful for adding Pixel Tracking in places that javascript is not supported.                                                                                                                                                               |         |
| Events            | Each request ingests a batch of events into Mixpanel. We accept up to 2000 events and 2MB uncompressed per request. Events are part of the request body.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         |
