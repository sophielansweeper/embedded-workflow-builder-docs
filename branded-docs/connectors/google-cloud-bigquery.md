A descriptive name for the dataset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |         |
| Default Table Expiration (ms)     | Optional. The default lifetime of all tables in the dataset, in milliseconds. The minimum lifetime value is 3600000 milliseconds (one hour). To clear an existing default expiration with a PATCH request, set to 0. Once this property is set, all newly-created tables in the dataset will have an expirationTime property set to the creation time plus the value in this property, and changing the value will only affect new tables, not existing ones. When the expirationTime for a given table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically. If a table's expirationTime is modified or removed before the table expires, or if you provide an explicit expirationTime when creating a table, that value takes precedence over the default expiration time indicated by this property. |         |
| Default Partition Expiration (ms) | This default partition expiration, expressed in milliseconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

When new time-partitioned tables are created in a dataset where this property is set, the table will inherit this value, propagated as the TimePartitioning.expirationMs property on the new table. If you set TimePartitioning.expirationMs explicitly when creating a table, the defaultPartitionExpirationMs of the containing dataset is ignored.
When creating a partitioned table, if defaultPartitionExpirationMs is set, the defaultTableExpirationMs value is ignored and the table will not be inherit a table expiration deadline. | |
| Labels | The labels associated with this dataset. You can use these to organize and group your datasets. You can set this property when inserting or updating a dataset. See Creating and Updating Dataset Labels for more information. | |
| Access | Optional. An array of objects that define dataset access for one or more entities. You can set this property when inserting or updating a dataset in order to control who is allowed to access the data. If unspecified at dataset creation time, BigQuery adds default dataset access for the following entities: access.specialGroup: projectReaders; access.role: READER; access.specialGroup: projectWriters; access.role: WRITER; access.specialGroup: projectOwners; access.role: OWNER; access.userByEmail: [dataset creator email]; access.role: OWNER. | |
| Creation Time | Output only. The time when this dataset was created, in milliseconds since the epoch. | |
| Last Modified Time | Output only. The date when this dataset was last modified, in milliseconds since the epoch. | |
| Location | The geographic location where the dataset should reside. See https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations for supported locations. | |
| Default Encryption Configuration | The default encryption key for all tables in the dataset. Once this property is set, all newly-created partitioned tables in the dataset will have encryption key set to this value, unless table creation request (or query) overrides the key. | |
| Satisfies PZS | Output only. Reserved for future use. | false |
| Is Case Insensitive | Optional. TRUE if the dataset and its table names are case-insensitive, otherwise FALSE. By default, this is FALSE, which means the dataset and its table names are case-sensitive. This field does not affect routine references. | false |
| Default Collation | Optional. The maximum staleness of data that could be returned when the table (or stale MV) is queried. Staleness encoded as a string encoding of sql IntervalValue type. | |
| Default Rounding Mode | Optional. Defines the default rounding mode specification of new tables created within this dataset. During table creation, if this field is specified, the table within this dataset will inherit the default rounding mode of the dataset. Setting the default rounding mode on a table overrides this option. Existing tables in the dataset are unaffected. If columns are defined during that table creation, they will immediately inherit the table's default rounding mode, unless otherwise specified. | |
| Max Time Travel Hours | Optional. Defines the time travel window in hours. The value can be from 48 to 168 hours (2 to 7 days). The default value is 168 hours if this is not set. | |
| Tags | Output only. Tags for the Dataset. | |
| Storage Billing Model | Optional. Updates storageBillingModel for the dataset. | |

| Default Trial ID  | Required. The body of the routine. For functions, this is the expression in the AS clause. If language=SQL, it is the substring inside (but excluding) the parentheses. For example, for the function created with the following statement: CREATE FUNCTION JoinLines(x string, y string) as (concat(x, ' |

', y)) The definitionBody is concat(x, '
', y) (
is not replaced with linebreak). If language=JAVASCRIPT, it is the evaluated string in the AS clause. For example, for the function created with the following statement: CREATE FUNCTION f() RETURNS STRING LANGUAGE js AS 'return '
';
'The definitionBody is return '
';
Note that both
are replaced with linebreaks. | |

| External Data Configuration | Optional. Describes the data format, location, and other properties of a table stored outside of BigQuery. By defining these properties, the data source can then be queried as if it were a standard BigQuery table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |         |
| Encryption Configuration    | Custom encryption configuration (e.g., Cloud KMS keys). This shows the encryption configuration of the model data while stored in BigQuery storage. This field can be used with models.patch to update encryption key for an already encrypted model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |         |

| Default Rounding Mode       | Optional. Defines the default rounding mode specification of new tables created within this dataset. During table creation, if this field is specified, the table within this dataset will inherit the default rounding mode of the dataset. Setting the default rounding mode on a table overrides this option. Existing tables in the dataset are unaffected. If columns are defined during that table creation, they will immediately inherit the table's default rounding mode, unless otherwise specified.                                                         |         |
| Max Staleness               | Optional. Defines the default collation specification of future tables created in the dataset. If a table is created in this dataset without table-level default collation, then the table inherits the dataset default collation, which is applied to the string fields that do not have explicit collation specified. A change to this field affects only tables created afterwards, and does not alter the existing tables. The following values are supported: 'und:ci': undetermined locale, case insensitive.'' empty string. Default to case-sensitive behavior. |         |

Leverage the page tokens to iterate through the entire collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         |
| Timeout (ms) | Optional. Optional: Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that the client is willing to wait for the query to complete. By default, this limit is 10 seconds (10,000 milliseconds). If the query is complete, the jobComplete field in the response is true. If the query has not yet completed, jobComplete is false. You can request a longer timeout period in the timeoutMs field. However, the call is not guaranteed to wait for the specified timeout; it typically returns after around 200 seconds (200,000 milliseconds), even if the query is not complete. If jobComplete is false, you can continue to wait for the query to complete by calling the getQueryResults method until the jobComplete field in the getQueryResults response is true. |         |
| Location     | The geographic location where the dataset should reside.

| Selected Fields | tabledata.list of table schema fields to return (comma-separated). If unspecified, all fields are returned. A fieldMask cannot be used here because the fields will automatically be converted from camelCase to snake_case and the conversion will fail if there are underscores. Since these are fields in BigQuery table schemas, underscores are allowed. |         |
| View            | Optional. Specifies the view that determines which table information is returned. By default, basic table information and storage statistics (STORAGE_STATS) are returned.

| External Data Configuration | Optional. Describes the data format, location, and other properties of a table stored outside of BigQuery. By defining these properties, the data source can then be queried as if it were a standard BigQuery table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |         |
| Encryption Configuration    | Custom encryption configuration (e.g., Cloud KMS keys). This shows the encryption configuration of the model data while stored in BigQuery storage. This field can be used with models.patch to update encryption key for an already encrypted model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |         |
| Default Collation           | Optional. The maximum staleness of data that could be returned when the table (or stale MV) is queried. Staleness encoded as a string encoding of sql IntervalValue type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |         |
| Default Rounding Mode       | Optional. Defines the default rounding mode specification of new tables created within this dataset. During table creation, if this field is specified, the table within this dataset will inherit the default rounding mode of the dataset. Setting the default rounding mode on a table overrides this option. Existing tables in the dataset are unaffected. If columns are defined during that table creation, they will immediately inherit the table's default rounding mode, unless otherwise specified.                                                         |         |
| Max Staleness               | Optional. Defines the default collation specification of future tables created in the dataset. If a table is created in this dataset without table-level default collation, then the table inherits the dataset default collation, which is applied to the string fields that do not have explicit collation specified. A change to this field affects only tables created afterwards, and does not alter the existing tables. The following values are supported: 'und:ci': undetermined locale, case insensitive.'' empty string. Default to case-sensitive behavior. |         |

| Default Dataset       | Optional. Specifies the default datasetId and projectId to assume for any unqualified table names in the query. If not set, all table names in the query string must be qualified in the format 'datasetId.tableId'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         |
| Timeout (ms)          | Optional. Optional: Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that the client is willing to wait for the query to complete. By default, this limit is 10 seconds (10,000 milliseconds). If the query is complete, the jobComplete field in the response is true. If the query has not yet completed, jobComplete is false. You can request a longer timeout period in the timeoutMs field. However, the call is not guaranteed to wait for the specified timeout; it typically returns after around 200 seconds (200,000 milliseconds), even if the query is not complete. If jobComplete is false, you can continue to wait for the query to complete by calling the getQueryResults method until the jobComplete field in the getQueryResults response is true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |         |
| Dry Run               | Optional. If set to true, BigQuery doesn't run the job. Instead, if the query is valid, BigQuery returns statistics about the job such as how many bytes would be processed. If the query is invalid, an error returns. The default value is false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | false   |
| Use Query Cache       | Optional. Whether to look for the result in the query cache. The query cache is a best-effort cache that will be flushed whenever tables in the query are modified. The default value is true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | true    |
| Use Legacy SQL        | Specifies whether to use BigQuery's legacy SQL dialect for this query. The default value is true. If set to false, the query will use BigQuery's GoogleSQL: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/ When useLegacySql is set to false, the value of flattenResults is ignored; query will be run as if flattenResults is false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | true    |

If unspecified, the project default is used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |         |
| Request ID            | Optional. A unique user provided identifier to ensure idempotent behavior for queries. Note that this is different from the jobId. It has the following properties: It is case-sensitive, limited to up to 36 ASCII characters. A UUID is recommended. Read only queries can ignore this token since they are nullipotent by definition. For the purposes of idempotency ensured by the requestId, a request is considered duplicate of another only if they have the same requestId and are actually duplicates. When determining whether a request is a duplicate of another request, all parameters in the request that may affect the result are considered. For example, query, connectionProperties, queryParameters, useLegacySql are parameters that affect the result and are considered when determining whether a request is a duplicate, but properties like timeoutMs don't affect the result and are thus not considered. Dry run query requests are never considered duplicate of another request. When a duplicate mutating query request is detected, it returns: a. the results of the mutation if it completes successfully within the timeout. b. the running operation if it is still in progress at the end of the timeout. Its lifetime is limited to 15 minutes. In other words, if two requests are sent with the same requestId, but more than 15 minutes apart, idempotency is not guaranteed. |         |
| Create Session        | Optional. If true, creates a new session using a randomly generated sessionId. If false, runs query with an existing sessionId passed in ConnectionProperty, otherwise runs query in non-session mode. The session location will be set to QueryRequest.location if it is present, otherwise it's set to the default location based on existing routing logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | false   |

| Default Table Expiration (ms)     | Optional. The default lifetime of all tables in the dataset, in milliseconds. The minimum lifetime value is 3600000 milliseconds (one hour). To clear an existing default expiration with a PATCH request, set to 0. Once this property is set, all newly-created tables in the dataset will have an expirationTime property set to the creation time plus the value in this property, and changing the value will only affect new tables, not existing ones. When the expirationTime for a given table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically. If a table's expirationTime is modified or removed before the table expires, or if you provide an explicit expirationTime when creating a table, that value takes precedence over the default expiration time indicated by this property. |         |
| Default Partition Expiration (ms) | This default partition expiration, expressed in milliseconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

When new time-partitioned tables are created in a dataset where this property is set, the table will inherit this value, propagated as the TimePartitioning.expirationMs property on the new table. If you set TimePartitioning.expirationMs explicitly when creating a table, the defaultPartitionExpirationMs of the containing dataset is ignored.
When creating a partitioned table, if defaultPartitionExpirationMs is set, the defaultTableExpirationMs value is ignored and the table will not be inherit a table expiration deadline. | |
| Labels | The labels associated with this dataset. You can use these to organize and group your datasets. You can set this property when inserting or updating a dataset. See Creating and Updating Dataset Labels for more information. | |
| Access | Optional. An array of objects that define dataset access for one or more entities. You can set this property when inserting or updating a dataset in order to control who is allowed to access the data. If unspecified at dataset creation time, BigQuery adds default dataset access for the following entities: access.specialGroup: projectReaders; access.role: READER; access.specialGroup: projectWriters; access.role: WRITER; access.specialGroup: projectOwners; access.role: OWNER; access.userByEmail: [dataset creator email]; access.role: OWNER. | |
| Creation Time | Output only. The time when this dataset was created, in milliseconds since the epoch. | |
| Last Modified Time | Output only. The date when this dataset was last modified, in milliseconds since the epoch. | |
| Location | The geographic location where the dataset should reside. See https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations for supported locations. | |
| Default Encryption Configuration | The default encryption key for all tables in the dataset. Once this property is set, all newly-created partitioned tables in the dataset will have encryption key set to this value, unless table creation request (or query) overrides the key. | |
| Satisfies PZS | Output only. Reserved for future use. | false |
| Is Case Insensitive | Optional. TRUE if the dataset and its table names are case-insensitive, otherwise FALSE. By default, this is FALSE, which means the dataset and its table names are case-sensitive. This field does not affect routine references. | false |
| Default Collation | Optional. The maximum staleness of data that could be returned when the table (or stale MV) is queried. Staleness encoded as a string encoding of sql IntervalValue type. | |
| Default Rounding Mode | Optional. Defines the default rounding mode specification of new tables created within this dataset. During table creation, if this field is specified, the table within this dataset will inherit the default rounding mode of the dataset. Setting the default rounding mode on a table overrides this option. Existing tables in the dataset are unaffected. If columns are defined during that table creation, they will immediately inherit the table's default rounding mode, unless otherwise specified. | |
| Max Time Travel Hours | Optional. Defines the time travel window in hours. The value can be from 48 to 168 hours (2 to 7 days). The default value is 168 hours if this is not set. | |
| Tags | Output only. Tags for the Dataset. | |
| Storage Billing Model | Optional. Updates storageBillingModel for the dataset. | |

| Default Trial ID  | Required. The body of the routine. For functions, this is the expression in the AS clause. If language=SQL, it is the substring inside (but excluding) the parentheses. For example, for the function created with the following statement: CREATE FUNCTION JoinLines(x string, y string) as (concat(x, ' |

', y)) The definitionBody is concat(x, '
', y) (
is not replaced with linebreak). If language=JAVASCRIPT, it is the evaluated string in the AS clause. For example, for the function created with the following statement: CREATE FUNCTION f() RETURNS STRING LANGUAGE js AS 'return '
';
'The definitionBody is return '
';
Note that both
are replaced with linebreaks. | |
| ETag | Output only. A hash of the resource. | |
| Arguments | Input/output argument of a function or a stored procedure. | |
| Return Table Type | Optional. Can be set only if routineType = 'TABLE_VALUED_FUNCTION'. If absent, the return table type is inferred from definitionBody at query time in each query that references this routine. If present, then the columns in the evaluated table result will be cast to match the column types specified in return table type, at query time. | |
| Return Type | Optional if language = 'SQL'; required otherwise. Cannot be set if routineType = 'TABLE_VALUED_FUNCTION'. If absent, the return type is inferred from definitionBody at query time in each query that references this routine. If present, then the evaluated result will be cast to the specified returned type at query time. | |
| Creation Time | Output only. The time when this dataset was created, in milliseconds since the epoch. | |
| Last Modified Time | Output only. The date when this dataset was last modified, in milliseconds since the epoch. | |
| Language | Optional. Defaults to 'SQL' if remoteFunctionOptions field is absent, not set otherwise. One of LANGUAGE_UNSPECIFIED / SQL / JAVASCRIPT / PYTHON / JAVA / SCALA | |
| Imported Libraries | Optional. If language = 'JAVASCRIPT', this field stores the path of the imported JAVASCRIPT libraries. | <code>["000xxx"]</code> |
| Description | Optional. The description of the routine, if defined. | |
| Determinism Level | Optional. The determinism level of the JavaScript UDF, if defined. One of DETERMINISM_LEVEL_UNSPECIFIED / DETERMINISTIC / NOT_DETERMINISTIC | |
| Remote Function Options | Optional. Remote function specific options. | |
| Spark Options | Optional. Spark specific options. | |

| Materialized View           | Optional. The materialized view definition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |         |
| External Data Configuration | Optional. Describes the data format, location, and other properties of a table stored outside of BigQuery. By defining these properties, the data source can then be queried as if it were a standard BigQuery table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |         |
| Encryption Configuration    | Custom encryption configuration (e.g., Cloud KMS keys). This shows the encryption configuration of the model data while stored in BigQuery storage. This field can be used with models.patch to update encryption key for an already encrypted model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |         |
| Default Collation           | Optional. The maximum staleness of data that could be returned when the table (or stale MV) is queried. Staleness encoded as a string encoding of sql IntervalValue type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |         |
| Default Rounding Mode       | Optional. Defines the default rounding mode specification of new tables created within this dataset. During table creation, if this field is specified, the table within this dataset will inherit the default rounding mode of the dataset. Setting the default rounding mode on a table overrides this option. Existing tables in the dataset are unaffected. If columns are defined during that table creation, they will immediately inherit the table's default rounding mode, unless otherwise specified.                                                         |         |
| Max Staleness               | Optional. Defines the default collation specification of future tables created in the dataset. If a table is created in this dataset without table-level default collation, then the table inherits the dataset default collation, which is applied to the string fields that do not have explicit collation specified. A change to this field affects only tables created afterwards, and does not alter the existing tables. The following values are supported: 'und:ci': undetermined locale, case insensitive.'' empty string. Default to case-sensitive behavior. |         |
