**%COMPANY_POSSESSIVE% %EMBEDDED_WORKFLOW_BUILDER%** is a low-code %WORKFLOW% tool your team can use to build %WORKFLOW_PLURAL% that sync data between %COMPANY_CORE_PRODUCT% and other applications and services you use.

Your %WORKFLOW_PLURAL% use built-in connectors to connect to third-party applications.
Using these connectors, you can query data in a third-party application to import into %COMPANY_CORE_PRODUCT%, or you can export data from %COMPANY_CORE_PRODUCT% to another service.

If you're syncing data between %COMPANY_CORE_PRODUCT% and a proprietary system you've built, you can leverage the generic [HTTP connector](./connectors/http.md) to make [requests](./http-requests.md) to any API that does not already have a built-in connector.

If you'd like to write code to help solve your problem, you can add JavaScript [code steps](./custom-code.md) to your %WORKFLOW% to manipulate data, make additional requests, or perform any other custom logic you need.

To get started building, check out our [getting started guide](./get-started.md).
